-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=back-to-the-drawing-board--really-great-drawing-reference-very-well>Back To The Drawing Board — Really Great Drawing Reference, Very Well&mldr;<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#back-to-the-drawing-board--really-great-drawing-reference-very-well>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://68.media.tumblr.com/bd1391b8986b99d655bb24aba33ffa4a/tumblr_n5yzwfaTvZ1tvrmkro6_1280.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qaJcafKEIoYOFYYaQ2FetwHaGM&pid=15.1"' alt="Back to the Drawing Board — Really great drawing reference, very well..."><p><em>Source: reillybrown.tumblr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>drawing reference.</p></blockquote><p>Gallery: A showcase of some beautiful wallpaper designs.
